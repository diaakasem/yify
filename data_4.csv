In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over by Beth B is the first career-spanning documentary retrospective of Lydia Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric artistry. As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late '70s, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say ""fuck you!"" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.In 2017, Lydia Lunch and filmmaker Beth B joined forces to create LYDIA LUNCH - The War Is Never Over a retrospective of Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric spoken word performance and music. The film frames Lunch's work through the lens of the various philosophical themes that have obsessed her for years to enlighten and empower women to voice the unheard and to break the cycle of violence toward women throughout the world. Lydia Lunch is the psycho-sexual transgressive who revoked patriarchal expectations of what a female performer might mean, while forging a vocabulary of rare emotional honesty, philosophy and humor.Director Beth B has known and worked with No Wave legend Lydia Lunch since the late '70s when they broke boundaries in New York City, confronting audiences with uncensored poetry, music and films. Reflecting on the groundbreaking defiance Lydia Lunch has personified for over 30 years, she is a survivor who creates a dialogue of universal truth through her music and performances. In 1984, she penned the subversive and prescient spoken word piece, ""Daddy Dearest"", defying the gag order and spoke out about the sexual abuse she suffered as a young girl at the hands of her father. Lunch continues to expose the patriarchy, sexual abuse, the cycle of violence, and corporate greed with stubborn resistance.In 1976, at age sixteen, Lydia Lunch arrived in the bankrupted ruins of NYC with the killer instincts of a born survivor, inspired by the ravings of Lester Bangs in Creem Magazine, the Velvet Underground's sarcastic wit, the glamour of the New York Dolls, and the poetic scat of Patti Smith's Piss Factory. Having escaped a disrupted and abusive childhood, Lunch's refusal to submit to anyone's will led her to forge her own reality on stage with the unprecedented brutality of Teenage Jesus And The Jerks - a central pillar of the No Wave music scene and a legendary name to this day. Everyone from Alan Vega and Martin Rev (Suicide), to the future luminaries of Sonic Youth, would embrace Lunch as the violent heartbeat of their art/music rebellion. When Brian Eno chose to produce the No New York compilation of 1978, Lunch was there as the shrieking voice and guitar fronting one of the most influential bands of the era: Teenage Jesus And The Jerks.LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over includes interviews with Lydia Lunch as well as some of her collaborators and colleagues including: Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth; performance artist Kembra Pfahler; Teenage Jesus bass player, Jim Sclavunos; Donita Sparks from L7; famed DJ and musician Nicolas Jaar; Art Critic Carlo McCormick; Filmmaker Richard Kern and a long list of other groundbreaking artists connected to Lunch's past and present.Filming in rehearsal and on tour with her band Retrovirus, the behind-the-scenes footage reveals a side of Lunch's personality that has been unseen. Her warmth and generosity in private interactions along with hilarious banter in the rehearsal studio with band members contrasts wonderfully with her brash, assaultive style of performance. ",3838

From 1971 to 1973, he had secretly recorded his private conversations, purportedly for the purpose of historical record, but in the wake of the Watergate scandal the revelation of the tapes led to his downfall.Fearing that the blunt and candid remarks on the tapes would sully the presidency forever, Nixon sought to prevent their public release for the rest of his life after leaving office. However, after his death in 1994, the government began releasing the 3,700 hours of recordings. The final tapes were made public on Aug. 20, 2013.In 1982, John Ehrlichman, Nixons former chief domestic advisor, voiced concern about the Nixon tapes, noting, The problem is that historians are going to grab an hour of tapeand if you listen to a snippet of tape, youre going to form an impression of this man thats going to be wrong. Sometime, hopefully, there will be a committee of historians who will listen to all the tapes and go into all the archives and then come out and say Richard Nixon was the strangest collection, the strangest paradoxical combination of any man I ever heard of. And theyll be right.Only Chief of Staff H.R. Bob Haldeman, Deputy Assistant Alexander Butterfield and Special Assistant Stephen Bull knew of the recordings. Those who did not know included John Ehrlichman, National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Deputy National Security Advisor Andrew Haig, Attorney General John Mitchell and Secretary of State William Rogers, among others. It was voice activated everything was taped which was probably stupid, Nixon conceded in 1983.The declassified tapes revealed the Presidents opinions on a vast number of topics, including the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers leak, his Supreme Court appointments, and other matters of state. Nixon derided anti-war protesters in private conversations with Henry Kissinger, saying, It really burns me up. We have no pride do we anymore, Henry? He had equally harsh words for young Vietnam vet John Kerry, calling him quite a phony. Years later, Nixon insisted that despite the anti-war sentiment in Congress and the media, That was not the voice of America. The voice of America was the silent majority.Nixons angry reaction to the New York Times publication of thousands of secret Pentagon documents detailing Americas involvement in Vietnam revealed his growing hatred of the press. This is treasonable action on the part of the bastards that put it out, he exclaimed to Henry Kissinger. Daniel Ellsberg of the Rand Corporation, who released the papers to the Times, became a target of his anti-Semitic outbursts. The Jews are, are born spies, he said, and asked Chief of Staff Haldeman to look at any sensitive areas around where Jews are involved.With two vacancies open on the Supreme Court and pressure mounting to nominate a woman, Nixon told the press his list of candidates included Mildred Lillie and Sylvia Bacon. But behind closed doors, he told John Mitchell, I would like to sorta get them off the woman kick if we can. Years later, Nixon called the appointment of the Supreme Court justices the most important achievement domestically of his presidency. Internationally, Nixon described his historic trip to China in 1972 as a watershed moment, and cited his trip to Moscow to negotiate an arms control agreement, as another major foreign policy achievement.The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy, Nixon can be heard telling Henry Kissinger. You must keep up the attack on the media. Youve got to keep destroying their credibility, he told Special Counsel Charles Colson. Whether calling them sons of bitches or bastards, Nixons distaste of reporters was only thinly veiled in interviews, and entirely open behind closed doors.After the Watergate break-in, Nixon discussed with Bob Haldeman bailing out the five men arrested saying, Well, they took a hell of a risk. And they have to be paid. Later, he told speechwriter Pat Buchanan, The Watergate thing well, thats going to pass. Thatll be over. Theyll indict a few people, and then the goddam things over.Despite Nixons reelection landslide victory and the achievement of what he called, peace with honor in Vietnam, Watergate did not pass. At the Senate Watergate hearing on July 16, 1973, former Deputy Assistant Alexander Butterfield revealed the secret electronic listening devices in the office of the president. Facing certain impeachment, Nixon subsequently resigned. ",9797

Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor.

The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode. Incest is the name of the game here. —Dejan Ognjanovic ",4949
