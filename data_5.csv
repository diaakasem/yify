Despite humble life circumstances, it was his voice that brought Komitas to the Holy See of Echmiadzin where, not being able to speak Armenian because it was forbidden by the Turks, Komitas addressed the supreme bishop, Catholicos Gevorg IV, ""I don't speak Armenian, if you wish I will sing."" His genius apparent, Komitas went on to study at the music college in Tiflis (Tbilisi), Georgia, then to Constantinople, Berlin, and Paris. Renowned musicians of the day, Vincent d'Indy, Gabriel Faure', and Camille Saint-Saens, were entranced by Komitas's music. The French composer Claude Debussi, following a concerto by Komitas, exclaimed, ""Brilliant father Komitas! I bow before your musical genius!"" The driving quest of Komitas's passion, his dream, was to bring to the world the music and folklore, both ancient and modern, of Armenian culture. He would travel the countryside of his Armenian homeland in search of not only Armenian songs and dance, but also that of the Kurds, Turks, and Persians. Komitas would meticulously record and interpret these gems of Anatolian culture to a wider European audience. Had Komitas been allowed to live out his life in fulfillment of his dream, what wonderful music can only be imagined. Tragically, this was not to be. Instead Komitas found himself a part of the other Armenian intellectuals and community leaders of Constantinople that were taken to a death march on the night of April 24, 1915. What Komitas experienced, the abject brutality and torture, defies description. Although spared death because of the intervention of influential Europeans and Americans, the experience led Komitas on a descent into madness. He was put into a French psychiatric hospital in 1916 where he spent the remaining years of his life until his death in 1935. —David Robert Deranian ",3939

""THE WAY OF NON-BEING
Deductions
1) This is a film that was born and developed in the spirit and in the perspective of not paying duty to any genre, understood as a cliché, but we can say that recognizing in its plot a sort of sacrificial plant could approach (derivatively) the classic genre of tragedy (Euripides in particular, which shares a certain impiety, in addition to the marked philosophical warping). Closer to home, because of its sacrificial (tragic) structure, I would liken it as a ""genre"" to ""The Seventh Seal"" or ""Meet Joe Black"", in which death is, respectively, externalized and internalized, but still acts with the aim of obtaining the sacrifice due to it.
2) In our intentions it would be the first step of a dialectical trilogy (that's what I think we'll call it in the end), through which we represent the external life/death splitting. This would be followed by the inner splitting (""we are and we are not what we were before""), set in the era of COVID, and finally by a kermis in four distinct episodes (two realistic and two surreal), coagulated around the idea of a spectator unaware of the fact that he is, himself, an element of the ""show"" he is witnessing, and this last step would be understood as that of reunification, determined by a sort of aesthetic self-motion (the three films, precisely).
3) The film opens with a passage from Parmedides (from the ""Poem on Nature""), and this is the source of its title. In our intentions, the film is also an open disavowal of Parmenides himself, in the sense that non-being (death, appearance) can at least be represented by drawing on an internal apperception. The sentence pronounced at the end of Riccardo's character ("" If the living and the dead could meet, no one would believe in the existence of God"") is not to be understood as a trivial hypothesis of denial of God himself (who can affirm or deny with certainty the existence? ) but it is nothing more than the transposition, in synthesis, of the synesthesia proposed by the film: that is, the contextual perception of life and death interacting with each other; and therefore should be understood in the sense that, if we admit to perceive and share a synesthetic reality (made of real plus unreal) it would no longer make sense to search for a unity external to thought.
4) The ""Way of non-being"" is the beginning of simultaneous perception (life/death, reality/appearance) or the synaesthetic way. It is also the way of critical consciousness that came out of Kantian irremediable dualism and landed in Hegel. On this path, it is possible to draw knowledge. On the other hand, understood in its aspect of ""visual art"", the film exhibits that imponderable which, not by chance, in impressionistic painting was externalized by light (the material source of cinema itself) and is now drawn within and represented as a gap in consciousness.
5) The structure of the film is at the same time a labyrinth and a red thread to get out of it (synesthesia also in this). The unknown of the sense is the enigma to be unveiled (the minotuar to be killed) and the labyrinthine structure is the result of a montage remade four times, always in a different way until the final one; the montage itself is the solution of the enigma, as a sort of its dialectical solution. In order to better understand it, we can compare the film to other works such as ""The Cube"" or ""Saw-The Riddler"", in which the labyrinth is all externalized, and the solution of the enigma is entrusted to the characters (most of whom succumb), with the difference that we have overturned exactly those scenic devices: the labyrinth is all interior, perceptive, or rather it is in the sole perception of the spectator or of the addressee, and not of the characters, because it is the spectator who is dispersed in rivulets and accesses that include images, dialogues and memories, all included in that ball that, as the narration proceeds, unravels little by little until the final solution, and the characters simply undergo that inexorable (tragic) unfolding. In other words: the film is a labyrinth that places at its center an enigma, its ""minotaur"", and the enigma is revealed as the ball of memory is unraveled. The title of the film was in fact ""The final color of the soul"", intended as the memory (the final color) that remains in the dead (hence the final reading of the passage from Plato's ""Republic"", and more precisely from the account of the myth of Er) but which is then diluted by drinking the water of the river Amelete to erase it and reincarnate. The editing of our film is the unraveling of that ball of yarn and thus resolves the labyrinthine enigma, that is, it erects the sense of the story, which is a search for the sense of death. ",6161

9,La Traviata,2009,ActionMusic,8.8 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/la-traviata-2009," Verdi is my favourite opera composer, and La Traviata is definitely in my top 5 of his operas(Otello, Don Carlo, Aida and Rigoletto are the other 4). I'm always touched by the story and the music is some of Verdi's most beautiful. This 2009 production from the Royal Opera House is not my favourite production of La Traviata, that's a tie between the Zeffirelli and Anna Moffo films. But it is a great production in many respects, with my only criticism being moments in Act 1 where apart from the highlights there is the sense that the stage director didn't quite know what to do. The costumes and sets are lavish, and the traditional stage direction doesn't cheapen the story or music in any way, has plenty of emotional impact and allows the singers freedom also. Act 3 is devastating as it should be but it is Act 2, especially the confrontation between Violetta and Germont, that is the triumph(then again maybe I'm biased as the heart of the opera and the best music is in this act). The orchestral playing gives the score poetry and pathos, the chorus are effectively rousing and Antonio Pappano's conducting is impeccable.The supporting cast are rock-solid, but La Traviata is basically a principal-driven opera and I was most impressed by all three. Renee Fleming's Violetta is a more mature interpretation than her earlier performance with Villazon, which people will like and some won't. I didn't see it as a problem, her diction does lack clarity in places but her personal and affecting acting, musicianship and the velvety sincerity in her voice make up for things in many ways. I am not a fan of Joseph Calleja but he has done things I have liked, like his excellent Edgardo from the Met. He does have a beautiful voice with a fast(but not too bleaty) vibrato that can be even better as it matures, he displays great chemistry with Fleming and while not perhaps youthful enough for Alfredo he does bring a certain charm to the role. Of the three DVD performances where he performs Germont, the others being Salzburg and Zurich if I remember correctly, it is here where Thomas Hampson gives his personal best interpretation in the role. His voice is of a strong and ringing quality, and his acting is stern and sympathy with a touch of pomposity, I saw very little stiffness that was there in his Zurich performance and that is a good thing.Overall, a beautifully sung and moving Traviata though not my first choice. 9/10 Bethany Cox ",4444

Of course, while dealing with missing jewels, a fake Lord, and blackmail attempts, Minot falls for the bride to be.A short amusing silent comedy, ""The Reckless Age"" stars handsome English actor Reginald Denny as Minot. Primarily known for his supporting work in such classics as ""Rebecca,"" ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" and ""Anna Karenina,"" Denny is the film's leading man. He displays startling blue-eyed star quality and a flair for comedy and slapstick; he also displays athleticism, especially when throwing a few punches at his antagonists. Lovely Ruth Dwyer plays Cynthia, the object of Minot's affections and Harrowby's designs; Dwyer is quite natural and works well with Denny. As the effete Lord Harrowby, William Astin also performs well, and the rest of the cast, today largely unknown, are quite good. Although an early silent, most of the cast avoid the flamboyant ""grand style,"" but they do let loose during an extended slapstick free for all in a newsroom. The cinematography is crisp, and the projection speed is correct; no jumpy images or sped up motion that stereotypes silent films for many.Reginald Denny's career peak was during the silent era, but he cannot be called forgotten, because he appeared in quality films into the 1940's and subsequently worked in television. However, he is largely forgotten as a leading man, and the ""The Reckless Age"" offers viewers an entertaining opportunity to rediscover what made the Englishman a silent star in Hollywood. ",4949
