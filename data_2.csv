It includes his rocky start in Hollywood as an aspiring screenwriter, which instead led to him working as a general filmmaker for an industrial film company. This work led to directing assignments for a number of television series back in Hollywood, where he butted heads with a number of studio executives and producers who did not appreciate his style of filmmaking in his desire to insert a sense a realism in whatever the project, that realism which includes hanging story-lines and overlapping dialogue, often in multiple equally important conversations in a single setting which forces the viewer to decide which conversation he/she wants to focus. This situation often led to him trying to achieve what he wanted either in not telling or flying beneath the radar of the studio executive and producers. Altman's cachet in Hollywood took a meteoric turn upward with the film M*A*S*H (1970) which all other directors approached had turned down, it which ended up being a box-office smash and critically acclaimed, including winning that year's coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Over the remaining course of his filmmaking life which included some highs and lows (including a string of box office and critical failures in the late 1970s and early 1980s), he tried to instill a sense of of family among the cast and crew of his sets. Beyond his marriage to Kathryn, the personal side to the story includes his being father to a number of children and step-children who would enter into the business, and some health issues, one which ended up in him having a heart transplant of which he did not tell the public until ten years after the fact. Interspersed with the archive footage is a number of celebrities - actors who have worked in his films and contemporaries influenced by his work - who give their definition of the adjective ""Altmanesque"". —Huggo ",55212

When news of a DNA match that fingers a new suspect surfaces, the team thinks justice will finally be served. But they quickly learn their fight has only just begun. ""I've thought about it and I could not see myself standing in front of anyone and admitting guilt in this crime, and if it takes me dying in prison, I will do that. I'd rather die in prison. And that's the truth."" -David McCallum You've probably never heard of David McCallum - his case has not garnered the attention of Mumia Abu-Jamal or David Milgaard in Canada - but for a quarter century, in relative obscurity, he has been tirelessly fighting to overturn his 1985 conviction for murder. When Ray Klonsky, a troubled Toronto teenager, began a letter correspondence with David McCallum, both of their lives changed forever. David helped Ray straighten out and Ray, in turn, has sustained David with hope during imprisonment in a New York State penitentiary. But what started as a simple friendship became a fight for justice with high-powered lawyers, world-renowned experts - including Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter - and concerned citizens coming together to fight for David's innocence and freedom. After befriending David, Ray set out to make a documentary about David's story, chronicling the ongoing efforts to fight his conviction. Now, nearly 10 years later, Klonsky and the team makes one final push for justice to be served. Cameras follow Ray every step of the way as they hit the streets in search of that one piece of evidence or witness testimony that could get the case back into court and ultimately free David. Reasonable Doubt is not just another wrongful conviction documentary; it is the real story of how a convicted murderer and a young Canadian filmmaker changed both of their lives forever. —Markham Street Films ",5050

16,Since I Been Down,2020,Documentary,5.8 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/since-i-been-down-2020," In 1993, Washington State voters passed the three-strikes law and sent children considered to be irredeemable super-predators to prison for life without parole. Influenced by the national drug war frenzy, escalating crime, and gang activity, during the fear-based political policies of the 1980's and '90's, Tacoma, WA sacrificed their most-vulnerable children. The city's lack of social services and targeted investments in early education, the increasing inequality in housing and employment, and the culture of punishment (including no-parole, three-strikes, hard-time for armed-crime, and other excessive sentencing laws), stained the Tacoma landscape and destined these children to live their lives behind bars. SINCE I BEEN DOWN is an American story showcasing one city, Tacoma, WA, as an example of ""Every town, USA"" through the eyes of a community decimated by drugs, poverty, and fear. Thrown into prison - not for education or rehabilitation, but for removal and punishment (""out of sight, out of mind"") - these children, who are now adults, could not be silenced. Together they built a prisoners' community of healing that extended beyond prison walls. The film is a dramatic chronicle of how gangs, fear, racism and power arrested the development of one American community, and how in their rush to discard the poorest by targeting brown and black youth for a false sense of safety, security and prosperity, an entire generation disappeared. SINCE I BEEN DOWN spotlights prisoner Kimonti Carter and follows his efforts, as well as a wide group of prisoners, as they break free from their fate and create a model of education that is transforming their lives, their communities, our prisons, and our own humanity.

It could be a trap,"" whispers Jane Birkin shyly into Agnès Varda's ear at the start of JANE B. PAR AGNES V.

When he was a boy in the Wyoming Territory, John William Goodnight was on a covered wagon that passed as the local stagecoach in the area with his farmer parents and Judge Aldous Shaw and his wife Rebecca Shaw, who the Goodnights had only just met before the start of their travels from what was then a town called Dry Gulch, which has now been renamed Crooked Stick. Targeting Judge Shaw who had just convicted their partner, bandits attacked the wagon, killing all on board except John and Mrs. Shaw, who ended up raising John as her own. A Chicago lawyer who believes in the law but not in lawyers, John, who lives hard and according to Rebecca should long ago have been dead because of it, has just been appointed by the Governor of Illinois as a circuit court judge for the Wyoming Territory, known as the most lawless region on the continent. Rebecca is the one who arranged this appointment, as she feels that John's recklessness is due to still being that tortured little boy who saw his parents killed, and that his restlessness will never cease without that one living bandit who killed his parents facing justice. Living by Rebecca's code, John strives for justice and not revenge though the law. In-between trying the cases brought before him in Wyoming, John tries to discover the happenings of that bandit that killed his parents and Rebecca's husband, he who was masked during the attack but who walks with a limp. When John reaches Crooked Stick on his travels, he finds that the town is run by a man named Dan Reed, who is able to do so because of his wealth. Dan operates by his own rules, which is all for himself, and damned anyone who is against him, including the law. Dan is not averse to murder to get what he wants. John is fairly certain that Dan is the bandit that he is looking for. He may be able to prove it with the help of a widowed local named Dr. Kate Ramsey, a woman who he is falling for, but proof may be a moot point if Dan and his men kill him and Kate first. John, however, may find that all is not as it first appears on the surface. —Huggo ",7575

This time out they are in Borneo searching for an orangutan to capture and sell to a zoo, but film everything in natural sight and stage a few other items. Martin Johnson died shortly after the Borneo expedition but his widow sold the footage to 20th Century-Fox's newsreel department and they took it from there. The fad for semi-real/semi-staged exploration/exploitation films was long over by 1937, and the people at Fox decided to jazz this up a bit in hopes of getting better bookings...and the Johnson-name still had an audience of its own. Lowell Thomas, a newsman who practically made an icon out of T. E. Lawrence all by himself and the lead commentator on Fox newsreels, was assigned the narration, after the studio editors finished cutting-and-splicing the Johnson footage down to something usable, and then another Fox-newsreel regular, Lew Lehr, was added to provide some comic-counterpoint to Thomas's doomsday narration. Lehr, as was his usual wont, employed his German-accent character, for the interruptive comments, few of which were all that funny...and absolutely none of which were expected to be taken seriously by the 1930s audience. The studio didn't reckon on this film being seen decades later by critics who knew not the era in which the film was released, and had no idea of who Lew Lehr (or Lowell Thomas) was...and evidently little knowledge of what constitutes propaganda. The only propaganda connected to this film was that done by the sales department of 20 Century-Fox in selling this film to the exhibitors. —Les Adams ",2323

The Story of Food Waste,2017,Documentary,7.5 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/wasted-the-story-of-food-waste-2017," The issue of food waste is presented in light of the statistics: forty percent of food produced for human consumption in the US goes to waste; over ninety percent of this amount will end up in the landfill, where the waste produces methane gas - a greenhouse gas - in an anaerobic process as no oxygen is able to get to the material to decompose it; the cost of food waste is $1 trillion annually; and that there is still a global problem of human hunger despite the food that goes to waste. Food activists, including chefs, some of the celebrity variety, discuss the issue largely in context of the Environmental Protections Agency's (EPA) food pyramid which lists the preferred priority for the food produced (in order): that it reach humans for consumption; that it be used for animal/livestock feed; that it be converted into energy in the form of compost and/or something that can be used or converted for use, such as into electricity. They discuss the measures that some individuals, organizations and businesses have implemented, they all recognizing that problems exist all along the chain, from production, to distribution, to storage, to consumption, to disposal. Some also recognize that a large part of the problem is defining what waste is, where, for example, forty percent of the biomass of a cauliflower plant is commercially sold for human consumption while closer to one hundred percent can be consumed by humans. —Huggo ",5858

The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully. —Dick Rockwell ",7777

Loyal Toms, carefree Sambos, faithful Mammies, grinning Coons, savage Brutes, and wide-eyed Pickaninnies roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs, minstrel shows, advertisements, folklore, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. These dehumanizing caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil Rights period and implanted themselves deep in the American psyche. Narration by Esther Rolle and commentary by respected scholars shed light on the origins and devastating consequences of this 150 yearlong parade of bigotry. Ethnic Notions situates each stereotype historically in white society's shifting needs to justify racist oppression from slavery to the present day. The insidious images exacted a devastating toll on black Americans and continue to undermine race relations. —Anonymous ",4545

11,Heroes,2020,DocumentarySport,7.5 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/heroes-2020," A new feature-length film focusing on the lives of five motor racing legends will be unveiled this July, in the week leading up to the British Grand Prix. The film, Heroes, has been written and directed by Manish Pandey, who ten years ago wrote the screenplay for the award-winning Senna.This new movie - commissioned by the Motorsport Network - brings together drivers from F1, sportscars and rallying who tell their stories to each other over an evening in an English stately home.The four racers are two-time Formula 1 world champion Mika Häkkinen, former Ferrari grand prix ace Felipe Massa, nine-time Le Mans winner Tom Kristensen and World Rally Championship runner-up Michèle Mouton.""I wanted to get racers of different ages and disciplines together but in a location that was out of their comfort zone,"" says Pandey. ""When you dig down into these characters, you discover - no matter what their background is - how much they have in common.""Though the motor racing disciplines differ, the stories they share across ten chapters in the film are broadly similar: their love of four wheels growing up, their big breaks, successes, failures, personal struggles and life-threatening accidents. Supplementing their narratives is a wealth of archive material, either gleaned from their personal collections or from the extensive library held at Formula 1 TV's headquarters at Biggin Hill.Heroes has unearthed some previously unseen archive from key races such as Jerez 1997 (Mika Häkkinen's first win), Interlagos 2008 (when Felipe Massa lost the world championship) and Monza 2006 (when Michael Schumacher's retirement was announced). Of the 65 minutes of archive in the film, over three quarters of it is from the F1 library.""Movie-making is very technical and there is always a formula,"" Pandey says, explaining the details of production. ""There are three acts. After a short setup where you're introduced to the characters, suddenly there is a twist. That sets you up for the next journey in the film before the final act, which is where everything changes.""There are techniques you can deploy. However, documentary film-makers have a responsibility when they tell the story of a living or deceased person because it needs to be the truth.""The final protagonist in the story is Michael Schumacher, who at some stage in his career has either worked or raced against the other four racers in the film. Häkkinen's first experience of racing Schumacher was at Macau in F3, before those epic Suzuka showdowns in the late '90s and early 2000s. Massa gets his big break as Schumacher's team-mate in 2006 and looked up to him as a father figure.After Tom Kristensen beat Häkkinen in the Formula Nordic A-Class karting championship in 1985, he raced alongside Schumacher in a handful of Formula 3 races - before encountering him again in the annual Race of Champions, an event organised and run by... Michèle Mouton.""It became clear with the drivers we had that while they would tell the stories of their lives, they would also be able to shine a little light on different facets of Michael,"" says Pandey. ""All four of them have Michael in common and I wanted him to be the fifth story. In the years since his skiing accident I've begun to appreciate the immensity of what he achieved on the track and the absolute love that surrounded him - especially at Ferrari."" ",6565

8,Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes,2022,Documentary,8.1 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/chernobyl-the-lost-tapes-2022," The story of Chernobyl told through a newly discovered hoard of dramatic footage filmed at the nuclear plant during the disaster and newly-recorded, deeply personal interviews of those who were there, directed by Emmy Award-winner and Russian-speaker James Jones. This gripping film tells the story of the disaster and its consequences entirely through extraordinary and immersive archive, shot at great risk in the hours, days, weeks and months after the accident by a handful of cameramen given access to the plant. These cameramen lived side by side with the ""liquidators"" who went to incredible and often fatal lengths to try to prevent another explosion and make the reactor safe. The reality of their bravery and heroism is more harrowing than any drama can portray. The footage, most of it never seen before in the West, has only now come to light after an extensive trawl by director James Jones of the state archives and other sources in Ukraine and Russia. For thirty-five years the story of what happened in April 1986 when the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant melted down has enthralled and horrified. Radio programmes and scripted dramas have all told their version of events. But no-one has made a documentary that reveals the full, shocking reality of this cataclysmic, world changing event - until now. Though many of the rescue workers died, a surprising number who appear prominently in the footage are still alive today. The film features newly recorded audio interviews with people involved in the original key moments of the footage - their memories of that fateful night and the aftermath haunting but also deeply humane. Amongst those interviews is Lyudmila Ihnatenko, whose firefighter husband Vasily died days after the accident, and who was pregnant at the time. She went onto lose her baby hours after she was born. ""All the radiation I was inhaling, she absorbed it."" From a ten-year-old schoolboy to a Russian general, we see how events at Chernobyl transformed the lives of millions of people. Soviet propaganda plays out as a backdrop, initially saying nothing of the disaster, Gorbachev eventually appearing to downplay what happened, putting his own citizens and the rest of the world at great risk. The film reveals how many people suffering from radiation poisoning, cancer and other illnesses were told that it had no connection to the accident. The state was in denial and was willing to lie to its own citizens to prevent the truth getting out. This film witnesses the incredible physical suffering of men who had sacrificed themselves for the greater good. The film shows how Chernobyl and the cover-up that followed sparked unprecedented distrust in the authorities, giving birth to a protest movement in Ukraine which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The modern resonance of a disaster which threatened millions of lives but was tragically mishandled by those in authority will have an obvious resonance to the contemporary audience. Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes is the full, unadulterated true story of what happened in one of the most iconic but least understood tragedies of the twentieth century. ",16463

It's true the six men are unsavory characters, bandits, killers and convicts but that's exactly what General Hood needs for his secret mission behind Union lines. Specifically, the Confederacy, which is short of cash, needs Union gold in order to continue the war. According to Captain Lynch, the Union is hiding an enormous sum in gold coins among dynamite sticks in an arsenal found in a Union stronghold. Clyde McKay's group, with occasional assistance from Captain Lynch, is to infiltrate the Union stronghold and steal the gold. McKay receives an advance payment for his services from General Hood. When he asks about his men's shares, in case they would be unable to return and collect the rest of the payments owed to them by the Confederacy, Captain Lynch replies that McKay should kill his men and return alone. Hence the Italian title of this film (translated into English it means: Kill Them All and Come Back Alone). —nufs68 ",2424

Tracking them for 24 hours we reveal the invisible threads that bind them together in a never-ending daily drama. This action-packed film will show how seven individual stories become one, how the animals move in and out of one another's lives in the course of a single day. Sometimes their encounters happen just by chance, at other times they are intent on stalking each other down. In all cases whenever they meet the encounter is always riveting. Each animal has different strengths, even some weaknesses, but seeing them in action is always impressive. Tracking them through one day and one night we witness their dealings with the neighbours from hell, staking their territory, stalking the same prey, risking their lives and cautiously interacting with or avoiding each other. This is a privileged and rare glimpse into the complex lives of Africa's Super Seven. Each species has its own vital role to play in this unfolding 24-hour drama. There is no room for the weak and in the African bush there's only one rule: the biggest, strongest, fastest and smartest survive. As amazing as these animals are, they all have their Achilles heel too, and occasionally our story includes a fight for survival for them just like any other creature of the untamed African wild. For Africa's Super Seven there are no free lunches. Some will pay the ultimate price and some will even be lunch. Not for the faint hearted, this is a story of power, trust, hunger, desperation and elation - an unforgettable adventure. —Joe Kennedy ",8989

But very few white lions have been witnessed in the wild over the past decade. Today, most white lions are born in captivity. Their rarity and beauty has condemned them to a destiny where they have become curiosities and hunting trophies. Their future as a wild species is now questionable. But there are people trying to change this - the local Shangaan tribe has revered white lions for centuries and with the help of Linda Tucker, head of the Global White Lion Protection Trust, a carefully planned release project is underway which will see the first four white lions return to the wilds of Timbavati.

Mainstream conservationists maintain that white lions are of little scientific conservation value and that they struggle to survive in the wild because of their lack of camouflage. On the other hand, big cat specialists point out that the original Timbavati white lions came from hardy stock that had lived in the wild for many years.
