She refuses to go with Lockley or to reveal to him her real identity. She only promises to secretly meet him the next day in a pub.

7,Shooting for Socrates,2014,ComedyDrama,5.9 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/shooting-for-socrates-2014," In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - ""a fee for this and a fee for that"") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - ""the next George Best"". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the ""top of the World"" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means. —Anonymous ",6666

Due to circumstances of the war, Oskar and Rachel become separated, with their love for each other still in tact. Oskar's mother, Marlene Koenig, upon learning of a Jewish woman in Oskar's heart, encourages him to pursue her, she willing to provide the resources to do so, which, if Oskar accepts her offer, would place both their lives at risk. Even if Oskar and Rachel were ever to encounter each other again, their experiences and the circumstances of the war may affect if they can join together as a couple, the war which may place them on opposing sides of a kill or be killed scenario. —Huggo ",2828

Though both have a distinct style, Heidi and Cassandra both love 70's and 80's horror films, trash & cult cinema, low budget filmmaking, and practical fx, so it comes as no surprise that a collaborative effort is in the works for them. Dolly Deadly is sure to be a little creepy, a bit silly, and a lot of fun (think Troma meets John Waters). The story of Dolly Deadly revolves around the warped psychology of a tormented young boy who can only relate to his doll collection, and the only relief from the pain in his life comes with slaughtering those he has learned to hate the most. Everyone in his trailer park! The film is to be a whirlwind of vengeful deaths, elaborate dream sequences, and crazy characters. In the production, there will not be any cgi, so all effects will involve handmade prosthetics and blood for all of the head wounds, chainsaw deaths, jaw cracking action, skinned faces, spurting blood, stab wounds, rotting corpse makeup, fire stunts, and explosions!

After not seeing her for ten years, Moses is contacted by Lila Shea, an old girlfriend from Berkeley, to do some investigative work on behalf of her boss, Sam Sebastian, the Southern California coordinator for the gubernatorial campaign of Congressman Miles Hawthorne.

HOGTOWN is nearly 20 years in the making, and is the second film in a trilogy and grows organically out of CHICAGO HEIGHTS, which was based on WINESBURG, OHIO, an 'unadaptable' seminal American novel. The film was named to Roger Ebert's last list of Best Art Films in 2010. The film is set circa 1919 in Chicago and begins with the disappearance of a millionaire theatre owner in a snowstorm. Its climactic sequences play out against the backdrop of the horrific race riots of that summer. The film is ostensibly about a murder investigation, but HOGTOWN is much more an exploration of this most American of American cities, looking into the intimate lives of many of its people. This 'period-less piece' is shot in undisguised contemporary Chicago, suggesting that the issues of its era resonate through the present. Herman Wilkins makes his feature debut as a leading actor in HOGTOWN, playing not just DeAndre Son Carter, the protagonist, but also Marquis Coleman, a major secondary character. The film is carried by a multi-racial, multilingual ensemble cast of more than 100, along with a full wind symphony and gospel score.

A box made of whale bone. Entangled in a fisherman's net and washed up on a remote beach in the Outer Hebrides. Once touched the box can change lives.The box was given to Iain Sinclair almost thirty years ago by Steve Dilworth, a sculptor based on the Island of Harris. It was always intended to be an active thing, kill or cure. An animal battery. And part of the power of the crafted box comes from its lack of signature. At best this object has the anonymity and moral authority of tribal art, of a fetish, a relic or an accidental survivor. It is dangerous. What is inside might produce good magic or it might produce bad magic but like the box that contained Schrödinger's Cat, it must never to be opened.
In 2018 the box was taken on an 800 mile reverse pilgrimage from London back to the Isle of Harris, in the company of the film-maker Andrew Kötting, the photographer Anonymous Bosch and the writer Iain Sinclair. There was unwellness on the island and they hoped that the box might help, however little did they know the delirium that they would unleash.
And all the while Eden Kötting narrates the story, working as both muse and mystic. She tries to make sense of the journey as it unfolds, sometimes awake and sometimes asleep. Ultimately the whalebone box is finally buried in the sand on the very beach from which it came all those eversomany years ago BUT something happens at the very end of the film after the credits have finished rolling, something extraordinary and miraculous....Incorporating elements of archive and pinhole photography the film is shot using mainly super 8 and super 8 apps. The film celebrates the notion of the home-made but is also an exercise in hauntological mad cap....The WHALEBONE BOX sees Andrew Kötting reuniting with Iain Sinclair for yet another remarkable collaboration after their critically acclaimed and ground baking Journeyworks: SWANDOWN, BY OUR SELVES and EDITH WALKS, except this time their machismo is undermined and subverted by the angelic presence Kötting's daughter Eden. She transports us into a world of wonder, to a place that the audience might never have been before.Eden Kötting born on 6th April is an English artist with Joubert Syndrome. Most of her work is rooted in the elsewhere.Andrew Kötting born on 16th December is an English artist, writer and filmmaker.

For some locals it's a personal passion and for others it's a lucrative business. Many tourists, mostly rich foreigners and explorers, come to Switzerland to attempt world records by climbing mountain peaks that have never been climbed or seldom been climbed before. Of course, some of these brave explorers lose their lives in their dangerous quests. The local Swiss villages provide experienced mountain guides and porters to the mountain climbers willing to pay the price, in coins or lives. Kurtal is such a small Swiss village located at the base of the famous Citadel mountain. The Citadel is the highest and the most dangerous peak in the region. Many have died trying to climb it but for the past 16 years no one has ventured on it. The last man to lose his life on the Citadel was the famous local mountain guide Josef Matt who died sacrificing himself in order to save the lives of his clients for whom he was serving as a guide. Josef's son, Rudi, is raised by his mother and by his uncle, Franz Lerner, who is also a professional mountain guide. Rudi is only 18 years old but he dreams of becoming a guide like his father. His family disapproves of Rudi's dangerous aspirations and relegate him to much safer jobs, such as being the dishwasher at the local motel run by Herr Hempel and his daughter Lizbeth. Often times, Rudi sneaks out of the kitchen to go climb smaller mountain peaks for exercise. Rudi knows the local rumor claiming that his father Josef had discovered a secret path to the summit of the Citadel on the day he died. Rudi hopes to one day climb the Citadel himself and find the secret path to the top his father supposedly discovered. One day, Rudi is at work washing dishes at the motel and he decides to sneak out of the kitchen in order to do a bit of mountain climbing. On the mountain, Rudi finds a stranded foreign tourist who got trapped when he fell onto a crag into a crevasse. Rudi throws a rope into the crevasse and saves the man who is none other than famed British mountain climber Capt. John Winter. The Captain thanks Rudi for saving his life and explains that accidents on the mountain could even happen to the most experienced climber. On their way back to town, Rudi and the Englishman pass by Rudi father's grave and the two pay their respects. The Captain reveals to Rudi that he believes in the dream of finding Josef's secret path to the top of the Citadel. In town, the Englishman hires Rudi's uncle Franz Lerner as a guide and convinces him to allow Rudi to come along as a porter. He also buys a new complete set of equipment and climbing gear for Rudy. Secretly, the foreigner wants to take a closer look at the famed and evil Citadel. When Rudi's uncle finds out the real aim of Capt. John Winter, he vehemently refuses to be the Englishman's guide to the Citadel. The Englishman leaves town and Rudi's uncle sells Rudi's new climbing gear that was gifted to Rudi by the foreigner. However, Rudi's girlfriend Lizbeth has purchased the hiking boots from Rudi's uncle and gives them back to Rudi. For the next few weeks Rudi undergoes a strict training in mountain climbing and guiding under the supervision of Teo Zurbriggen, Rudi father's old partner. Teo tells Rudi to never work for praise, glory and rewards but rather for the safety of his clients. Soon after, the locals spot two men, climbing the Citadel, through a telescope. One of them is Englishman John Winter and the other is Emil Saxo, a Swiss mountain guide from a nearby rival village. The next day, curious onlookers spot three men climbing the Citadel.
