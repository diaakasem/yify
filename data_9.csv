Baker was now odd-man-out at the studio as his contract had been with Trem Carr, and Carr and associate Malvern had moved over to Monogram to begin a series of four ""Tailspin Tommy"" features. Universal, usually late to the party anyway, added Baker and comedian Fuzzy Knight to the first-six Brown films to form a trio angle along the lines of Republic's highly successful ""Three Mesquiteers"" series, but there were no continuing roles in these films---they even killed Baker off in the 2nd film---and Baker's 2nd-lead soon went to 3rd-lead (behind Knight) and then to ""gone"" after the sixth film. When Bob Baker was next seen in a film at Universal, it was as the uncredited bus driver in Abbott and Costello's ""Ride 'Em Cowboy"" in 1942. From this point onward, Fuzzy Knight was the sidekick in every B-series western made by Universal until they closed shop on series westerns and serial production when they merged with International Pictures to become Universal-International: In this one, Steve Hayden, working undercover, comes to Denton to help restore law and order.

Although they like most of the women at the WI (the friendship part), they, but the perceived flaky Chris in particular, hold the way Marie (Geraldine James), the local President, runs the chapter with derision. They find much of what goes on there, especially the monthly presentations, banal and devoid of enlightenment and fun. Equally as banal was last year's fund-raising calendar, featuring local bridges, which raised a meager £75.60, with this year's proposed calendar, local churches, promising to be even more so. After Annie's husband John (John Alderton) dies from leukemia, Chris wants the WI to provide a memorial in his memory: a new sofa for the family room at the hospital. The one Chris wants to buy costs nine hundred ninety-nine pounds sterling, which she proposes to raise by changing the fund-raising calendar to one featuring tasteful photographs of nude Knapely WI members. She got the idea by seeing all around her the notion of the old adage that sex sells. Annie likes the idea as it is analogous to one of horticultural-loving John's last statements about plants being the most glorious in the latter stages of their life, after which they quickly go to seed. To get the project off the ground, they not only have to convince nine other WI members to pose (December to be a group photograph), but they have to find a photographer they trust that will treat this task as an art project. Conversely, they aren't sure if they and the calendar will meet with the same contempt from Marie, the national WI organization and their friends and family that they are so trying to change in the Knapely WI, and in the process not only not raise the necessary money, but, in fact lose money instead. or the project in any form may have its own consequences, especially for Chris. —Huggo ",5151

18,In Bed with an Elephant,1986,Documentary,7.7 / 10,https://yts.rs/movie/in-bed-with-an-elephant-1986," I give this movie a 7/10. This movie was very informative and provided a lot of information on US Canada relationships since the Civil War. I was surprised to find out about how the relationship has been up and down since then. I was also very surprised to find out about Article XI of the Articles of Confederation and how the US just kind of expected Canada to join the confederation. I was surprised that the relationship between the two countries has been so bad considering how close the two countries are to each other and how easy it would be for them to trade with each other. I thought it was interesting how many of the previous Prime Ministers were nationalists that put tariffs on imports and made an attempt to promote Canadian industry.I feel like this film was very biased toward the Canadian side of the argument. During the whole film the majority of things said about Americans is sort of how they are better than Canadians. Being American myself I found this, along with the narrator's monotone voice, made the movie very difficult to watch and stay awake.Overall I found this film to be very interesting and provide another point of view on a pretty complex relationship. Oftentimes people in the US sort of forget about their neighbors in the north despite the long, turbulent relationship the multiple leaders of the two countries have had. ",2929

And yet these two artists (a word both men scoffed at) were the best of friends, right up to their deaths a mere seven weeks apart in 1961. But is the friendship of these two men really so surprising? A study of these two men is a study of the 20th century. Their internationally renowned careers (Cooper, two Best Actor Academy Awards; Hemingway, Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes) were played out over the same turbulent decades: the hedonistic 20s, the grim Depression 30s, the war-ravaged 40s, and the deceptively slumbering 50s; throughout, their public and private lives connected, parted, re-connected, intertwined, over-lapped, and collided.
